*  A brief description of each file and its purpose

TileInterface.java: the interface for Tile.java

Tile.java: implement the individual Tiles on the grid of the game. Allow 
helper functions and other functions to manipulate the movements, appearances,
or interactions that these Tiles have with each other and with the board.

BoardInterface.java: the interface for Board.java

Board.java: sets up all the functions to enable the user's input to be 
converted to moves within the game. Allow each move to have the effect of 
moving all the Tiles and merging them accordingly to get the value 2048.

TwoZeroFourEight.java: the main file to run the game. Draws out the aesthetics
of the game, sets up user input to enable the movements in the game. Track to 
see if the player has won or lost the game.
